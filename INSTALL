This document covers the installation of SIF and SIFEI. After installation, an end-user should be able to run SIFEI.

System requirements:

- Computer with x86 or x86_64 architecture (or a virtual machine)
- Microsoft Windows 7 or 8.x
- Microsoft Excel 2013
- Oracle Java Runtime Environment 1.6 or higher
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5
- Visual Studio Redistributable 2010

Other environments *might* work but have not been tested. Below are the steps for a sample installation:

First, we install the environment:

1.) Install Windows 8.1 (tested with enterprise 64bits)
2.) Install Java Runtime Environment (tested with 1.7u60)
3.) Install Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus
4.) Install Visual Studio Redistributable 2010 (or higher)
5.) Add java to your PATH environment variable

We skipped the following, because Windows 8.1 already includes them (you need it if you run Windows 7 though):

6.) Install .NET Framework 4.5

Now we can install the SIF and SIFEI distribution (this assumes the artifacts have been built already):

1.) Copy Folder "Spreadsheet Inspection Framework" to C:\ (blanks are required and the path is hardcoded currently, sorry!)
2.) Run setup.exe in SIFEI-Installer folder
